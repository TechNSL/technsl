# AWS Compute Services

AWS provides a comprehensive set of compute services that allow you to run applications and workloads in the cloud. These services offer flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency for various computing needs.

## Key Compute Services

- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers in the cloud for running applications.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service for running code without provisioning servers.
- **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Container orchestration service for Docker containers.
- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Managed Kubernetes service for containerized applications.
- **AWS Fargate**: Serverless compute engine for containers.
- **Amazon Lightsail**: Simple virtual private servers for small applications.

## Choosing the Right Compute Service

- Use EC2 for traditional virtual machines and full control.
- Use Lambda for event-driven, serverless applications.
- Use ECS/EKS for containerized workloads.
- Use Fargate for serverless containers.
